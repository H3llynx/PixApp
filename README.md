# Feline Leaf Chase: A Simple Jump Game

**Feline Leaf Chase** is a tiny, fully responsive browser game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pick your favorite cat, then try to catch a flying leaf by making your cat jump at just the right moment. Win, replay with a new background, or exit—the game is easy, lighthearted, and works on any device.

## Gameplay

- **Choose your cat:** Pick between Pixie (the inspiration for this game!) or Maya (a much-missed former companion).
- **Jump to catch the leaf:** A leaf floats by — help your cat leap and grab it!
- **Win, replay, or exit:** Catch the leaf to win! Replay for a new background, or quit anytime.
- **Simple controls:** Play with mouse, keyboard, or touch.

## Features

- **Fully responsive:** Works great on mobile, tablet, or desktop—play anywhere!
- **Randomized fun:** Each jump’s height varies randomly (within an easy range), making timing lively but not frustrating.
- **Cat personality:** Sometimes, rather than jumping… your cat rolls lazily on the floor (it’s random, and it looks cute).
- **Replay mode:** Every replay brings a new background.
- **Accessible:** Supports keyboard/touch/ARIA for a wider audience.

## Inspiration

This goofy mini-game is inspired by **Pixie**, my own cat — who avoids all exercise unless provoked. One day, I tied a forbidden leaf from a houseplant to a ceiling fan with toilet paper, spun it up, and suddenly Pixie was flying through the air to catch it! That’s how the “flying leaf” challenge in the game was born.

## Code highlights

- **Collision detection:** Uses circle-based math to detect if your cat catches the leaf.
- **No dependencies:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — lean and easy to tinker with.

## Why I built it

This was a JS/DOM practice project—learning by building, with a silly twist. It’s simple, fun, and, most importantly, gave me a reason to put Pixie in the code.
